# Overview

TFProfiler is an app that aims to profile [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) model and measure its performance using FPS, inference time, memory consumption with different delegates (CPU, GPU, NNAPI, HEXAGON).

- **API SDK 21+**
- **Written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)**


# Features

The app displays a list of models built inside the app that can be used to measure its performance on device. Also, you can upload your *.tflite model and see how it works on the smartphone.

# Performance tips

We can boost model performance and energy efficiency using various optimization techniques.

Model optimization aims to create smaller models that are generally faster and more energy efficient, so that they can be deployed on mobile devices. 

1. Use [XNNPACK](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/07/accelerating-tensorflow-lite-xnnpack-integration.html) to boost float-point inference.

2. Use [GPU](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/gpu) delegate to compare with CPU and other options. If some of the ops are not supported by the GPU delegate, the TF Lite will only run a part of the graph on the GPU and the remaining part on the CPU.

3. Experiment with [NNAPI](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/nnapi) (Android API 27+) delegate to see whether the models works faster on Android.

4. Try to use [quantization](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/model_optimization#quantization) to optimize model.

5. Accelerate TFLite model on Qualcomm [Hexagon DSPs](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2019/12/accelerating-tensorflow-lite-on-qualcomm.html)
